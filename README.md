This is a template project for building API applications using FastAPI, Poetry, and Tortoise ORM.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before setting up the project:

- Python 3.11.3 or above
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, required for running the database with Docker)

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/plusiv/fastapi-tortoise.git
   cd fastapi-tortoise
   ````
2. Install the project dependencies using Poetry:
    ```bash
    # This will install all project dependencies.
    poetry install
    ```

    _Optionally install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks._
    ```bash
    # Install pre-commit (optional)
    poetry run pre-commit install
    ```
3. Create `.env` file and add environmental variables values
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    vim .env
    ```
4. Run schema creation and seeders (optional):
    ```bash
    poetry run python -m app.database.db_seed
    ```
5. Run project
    ```bash
    poetry run uvicorn --reload app.main:app
    ```
### Tests
To run tests you can enter:
```bash
poetry run pytest
```

### Pre-commit
If you want to run pre-commit to make sure that you're doing a good jon, just run:
```shell
poetry run pre-commit run -a
```

## Tech Stack + Features

### Frameworks
- [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/lo/) â€“ A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

### Database + ORM
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - An open-source relational database management system.
- [Tortoise ORM](https://tortoise.github.io/) - Tortoise ORM is an easy-to-use `asyncio` ORM (Object Relational Mapper) inspired by Django.

### Storage
- [Minio]() - __TODO__

## Access Control
 - [Casbin](https://github.com/casbin/pycasbin) - An authorization library that supports access control models like ACL, RBAC, ABAC for multiple Languajes.

## Code Quality
- [Super Linter (Github Action)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter) - A simple combination of various linters, written in bash, to help validate your source code. Linters are:
    - [Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/) - An extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust.
    - [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) - A Python code formatter.
    - [Hadolint (Dockerfile)](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) - A smarter Dockerfile linter that helps to build best practice Docker images.
    - Github Actions - A linter for Github Actions.
    - Yaml - A Yaml files linter.
    - Markdown - A Markdown linter.
- [Pre Commit](https://pre-commit.com/) - Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before submission to code review.
    - check-ast - simply checks whether the files parse as valid python.
    - check-toml - checks toml files for parseable syntax.
    - detect-private-key - detects the presence of private keys.
    - end-of-file-fixer - ensures that a file is either empty, or ends with one newline.
    - fix-encoding-pragma - adds `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` to the top of python files.
    - name-tests-test - verifies that test files are named correctly.
    - trailing-whitespace - trims trailing whitespace.
    - black - A Python code formatter.
    - ruff - An extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust.
    - hadolint - A smarter Dockerfile linter that helps to build best practice Docker images.
